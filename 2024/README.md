# Advent of Code 2024

https://adventofcode.com/2024/

Solutions will be done in Rust.

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release --bin day01
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test --bin day01
```

## ENV Variables

`INPUT` can be set to provide a path to a specific file as input. Otherwise, `inputs/day{ID}.txt` will be used.

## Personal Times

Times are normalized from input download to correct answer, not the time on the website.
